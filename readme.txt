Project 1: Unix System Calls and Library Functions

Exercise 3.9: Process Fans (p. 88) in Robbins/Robbins text

Description of problems encountered:

- Had trouble with gargled print output and with extra lines being read from stdin.
This was fixed after I had child processes start executing new processes.

- Also learning new c functions was time consuming. I learned new c functions by
reading the robbins textbook, man pages, and various other sources.

I learned a lot in this assignment.
